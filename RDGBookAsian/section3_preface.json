              "text": "Once we make a decision to recover from addiction — to sub stances, habits, people, whatever — it can be scary. The feeling is often one of loss and loneliness, because recovery can shake our sense of some of our core identities, and the concept of who we are. How will I relate to others? How can I remain steadfast in my decision? Change can be hard to face, even if we know we’re letting go of something that’s a danger to us. Recovery Dharma offers resources and a supportive setting for this brave change no matter what part of the journey you’re on.",

The Buddha taught that due to craving, greed, anger, and confusion, the mind may be a source of great suffering. With this path, we’re using an ancient and proven way to transform our minds and behavior. We’re choosing to trust in our own potential for wisdom, awakening, and compassion for others and ourselves.",

It’s structured around the “three jewels” of Bud dhism: the Buddha (the potential for our own awakening and the goal of the path), the Dharma (the teachings/how we get there), and the Sangha (our community of wise friends/who we travel with). We’ll share how we have used these teachings to recover from addiction in a way that honors what is wise and helpful for us individually, as opposed to a one-size-fits all approach.",

We encourage you to adapt this book and create inquiries that may help promote healing, growth, and understanding based on your own identity and experience.",
