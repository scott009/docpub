Like so many of us, I grew up never being taught what to do with my feelings, raised by parents who were never taught what to do with theirs. And like so many of us, trauma scarred my young life. I expe rienced those traumas alone, with no tools except the ability to compart mentalize my feelings and fragment myself. It is no surprise that when I discovered drugs and alcohol at the age of thirteen, it felt like an epiph any. Here was the perfect way to run from myself, to numb my pain, to create what felt like a safe little world all my own where no one could touch me. And even when they did touch me, I couldn’t feel it.

Right from the start, I loved using alone. That was my preferred way of getting high, although of course I also did it socially. I would also get high secretly and not tell anyone, sitting there surrounded by people, feeling like a ghost. But what I loved most was sitting in my room by myself, convincing myself that this place I created inside my head was the real world, and the one outside, the one full of people and pain, was just an illusion.

The first time I went to rehab, I was sixteen, driven by a depres sion that no amount of drugs seemed to improve. I wanted it to work, and I approached sobriety like the straight-A student I was. But after a year and a half, I was lonelier than ever, and I convinced myself that I could drink and use like a normal person. Not even two years later, I dropped out of my dream college, addicted to cocaine, suffering severe mental health issues, and wanting to die.

By the time I finally got sober at age twenty-eight. I had spent years eking out alife despite myself. I hit a few bottoms on my way there, but somehow I ended up with a promising career, a nice partner, and a house. As always, I lived a double life, my troubled inner world hidden by my armor of privilege and accomplishment. But I was so tired. I had tried in vain for years to control my drinking and drug use, doing all the things we do to lie to ourselves. I managed to quit drugs, but I would always drink again, not knowing what else to do with the feelings that would inevitably come up, the discomfort I had no idea how to sit with.

I went to rehab again and threw myself into AA. I was lucky to have gotten sober in the Bay Area, where the 12-step community was diverse and progressive, where it was possible to find a cozy niche of women’s and queer meetings that felt like home, where they didn’t say the Lord’s prayer, and where their approach to the program and the Big Book was more trauma-informed and less dogmatic than many other places.

For the first time in my life, I felt like I found my people, and I began finding myself. I learned how to be close to people. I learned how to take responsibility for my actions, and I learned that my actions affect ed other people. Somehow, that had never occurred to me. I had been so consumed by my own pain for so much of my life, in some way I had started to believe I was the only one who felt anything.

I had a good early recovery in 12-steps, and I am grateful. In my first few years, I also started exploring Buddhism, going to a day-long retreat and a few meditation groups here and there, reading everything I could find about a Buddhist approach to the 12-steps. I thought I, and my program, were invincible. At five years sober and a mother to an almost one-year old, my partner and I decided we were done with city living and moved across the country to the mountains of North Carolina. I had always been good at moving, running from problem to problem and starting over somewhere else. But this time, I wasn’t running from something — or so I thought. My life in the Bay Area had been wonder ful, but I was ready to start the next chapter of my life.

Something was missing, and I thought I would find it in this unfamiliar place surrounded by strangers.

But it didn’t go quite as planned. I had expected to just fall into 12-steps here and find a new friend group like I did back in California. But the meetings were weird, full of a southern Christian God and what seemed like questionable recovery. The old-timers sounded like cult lead

ers. The repetition of readings and sayings and slogans began to wear thin. With the stress of a young child and a huge life transition, and with out the community we had back in the Bay, the cracks in my marriage also started to show. I was lonely in North Carolina, and the foundation

of both my recovery and my personal life was starting to feel shaky. Then I found a flier on a coffee shop bulletin board for a Bud dhist recovery group, and I decided to give it a try. The meeting was just a handful of quirky-looking people sitting on cushions in a circle on the floor, talking about their lives in what felt like a refreshingly intimate and authentic way. I immediately felt like this was the room I wanted to be in. Over the next several months, I found a home in this new com munity. I began to see my personal growth with a Buddhist lens, addic tion as something much deeper than a dependency on chemicals or even a disease. Yearning was the human condition, and we addicts, through whatever concoction of trauma and adverse childhood experiences and hereditary influences, came to feel these yearnings more intensely, often for things beyond substances. Buddhism deepened my recovery in ways

I never imagined possible in 12-steps, inviting me to not only look out ward at systems created by others, but ultimately look inward and trust my own Wisdom.

### ID: p31-16
That is not to say I think I know all the answers. I certainly knew very little about how to live an honest and healthy life when I got sober, and I needed to look outward for wisdom, to trusted groups and people who I knew had something valuable to teach me. I believe being humble is essential to wisdom. But as my recovery deepens, so does my trust of

my ability to make healthy choices — and to also know when I need help figuring out what those healthy choices are.

### ID: p31-18
It is easy for me to focus solely on the inward-looking aspects of Buddhism and convince myself sometimes that this is a solitary path. But there is a reason sangha is one of the three jewels at the core of this path, and I know I cannot do this alone.

### ID: p31-19
It is easy for me to make Buddhism complicated, to over-intel lectualize, but I also know that I feel most grounded when I focus on just being with experience rather than judging or analyzing it. When in doubt, I remind myself of the core teaching: do no harm. I remind myself that includes not doing harm to myself.

Buddhist recovery has taught me the importance of being kind and gentle to myself. It has taught me to look at my intentions and mo tivations for doing things. It has helped me understand that I can find peace regardless of what is happening outside of myself, and that I do not need external validation to feel that I am enough. And I am finding that the more I feel that I am enough, the less I crave other things to fill me up.

When we started Recovery Dharma, one of our core intentions was to emphasize that this is a program of empowerment, not powerless ness. Acceptance of what is is part of equanimity and integral to our lib eration, but that is not the same as powerlessness. As a writer, I know that words matter. As a survivor of trauma among so many other survivors of trauma, I know that powerlessness is not what I want my recovery to be based on. Instead, I see my recovery as a path towards wholeness and embodied, empowered choices.

I may not always have power over what happens in the world, what happens to me, or even my own feelings, but I have power in how I choose to respond. Sometimes that power is limited by old patterns and trauma response, but it is still there. My Buddha nature, my liberation, is always inside me, always accessible. I have the power to be kind and gentle to myself and others. I have the power to set boundaries, and also to forgive. I have the power to look at my various human yearnings and

discern what is motivated by craving versus what is motivated by curi osity, connection, and joy. I have the power to be present and breathe through whatever life brings me, and to be grateful for all of it.

Dharma, sobriety, and my identity are delightfully blended. The pivotal push to getting sober was a feeling of disconnection from my chosen family, and from myself. An occasionally deep, often mild, haunting sensation of hindered intimacy. I wanted to show up and be truly me, meeting truly them, but there was always this cloudy curtain between us.

When I was eleven, I started with alcohol, and my mom was one of those “as long as it’s at home, substance use is okay” kind of par ents. I was eleven and a lot of my friends were sixteen, so you know we were drinking and driving, and then soon added pot, and acid, and mushrooms. I grew up in rural Ohio, and nature was a big part of my experience as a teen. We talked like we thought the substances brought us closer to nature and its beauty and mystery, but probably we would have gotten closer to the elements had we been sober and actually present. Ei

ther way, I was able to escape home and two parents who didn’t talk, slept in separate beds, and yet supposedly were staying together for me — by zipping off and flying high with my crew. I also did a lot of drugs with my mom. She introduced me to cocaine, meth, and crack. Our shared dependence was a distorted parent-child closeness. She was, and still is, hurt and lonely.

I excelled in my tiny Catholic high school. I was a perfectionist, took all the advanced classes, skipped a grade in French, wrote for the newspaper, pushed vegetarianism. I eventually graduated as the valedic torian. I’d jam all my homework during lunch time so that I’d be free to check out as fully as possible from after school until bedtime with drugs. And that was the cycle, day after day.

My queerness emerged early on. In 6th grade, I famously de clared, “When I grow up, I’m going to be bisexual.” Which to this day, I’m fully embodying. However, in small town, sex-negative USA, this was easier said than done. When I became (at that time) a girl kissing girls, the hang ups and harassing phone calls to our house line started happen ing. I never denied my desires or who I am, and I paid for it, but I never considered another way to be. I had a high school girlfriend when I was in 8th grade, and we partied and learned bodies.

College and grad school were more of the same. Me working so hard and then rewarding myself at the end of the day and fuzzing out. More and more special people came into my life, through queer, activ ist, and academic communities. I love relationship building, exploring,

navigating, co-finding channels for growth and creativity. Yet I felt the channels were blocked, and separation was apparent.

In Fall 2012, I decided my drinking was out of control. I had never really liked alcohol. Both of my parents were alcoholics and ad dicts, and I just couldn’t be like them. So I cut out the alcohol, because I thought that was the problem. Things definitely felt less chaotic, and my body felt better. But the drugs continued - so much marijuana daily, plus MDMA and psychedelics often. The disconnection with my romantic partners was palpable, so I enacted a “sober sex only” policy for myself and my dates. I learned quite a bit about queerness, presence, and sub

stances then. Many people couldn’t easily set aside drinks and/or drugs in preparation for sex. These early negotiations around substances and physicality were significant. They were empowering, and I was able to practice directness and consent.

Yet stopping at sober sex wasn’t enough. After six months of the policy, the same six months on gender-affirming hormone therapy, I went on a trip to Las Vegas with a sex worker collective I was part of, and — while I didn’t know that it would be the last time — I took my last dose of drugs in the desert. The next day was my dad’s birthday, not an uncomplicated date, and that became my sobriety anniversary.

### ID: p31-37
I stopped because I had had enough. On that desert walk in my altered state, alone but with others, I just thought about how I could get to so many of these same places with my meditation practice and so much less clinging and opacity. I was in the middle of a 90 and 90 meditation challenge I was doing with a dharma buddy, where we would meditate 90 minutes a day for 90 days. I was committed, and I was ready for change.

Upon abstaining, I had a built-in network of sober friends from my meditation community, which held a lot of sober punks. At the same time, it felt like a magnificent shift and very organic. It was simple, but not easy. I lost friends. I broke up with most of my romantic relation

ships. A lot of people asking “WHY???” “You don’t have a problem?” “You never seemed like things got out of control,” etc., etc. This still happens, and I’m celebrating my ten-year soberversary.

Getting sober required a lot of release. Staying sober requires doing all the ancillary work, in addition to being active in a recovery community. Dharma, sangha, honesty, connection, communication, compassion, rupture, repair…this one-line string of words and principles encapsulates an ever-challenging life practice of being a better person and causing less harm and bringing more joy into the world. I’m extremely

grateful to be embedded in a community that can reflect back these val ues while we all stumble trustfully together.

I am one of the stewards of our first NYC-area queer Recovery Dharma meeting, and it’s truly magic. Queer and trans people healing together on this path, we especially need each other and this space where we can process shared experience and difficulties. Service has always been a large part of my recovery. Whether I was an Intersangha Rep, or Events Chair organizing daylong retreats and my favorite — the New Year’s Eve gathering, meeting chair, mentor/wise friend, meeting location finder and conduit…showing up, opening up, being an anchor, feeling an chored by others, and holding space is central to nourishing the group’s collective health and continuation.

I like this saying that I’ve heard from a few Dharma teachers, “Don’t waste your suffering.” For me, this points to the power of transfor mation in the Eightfold Path. It’s especially supportive because it’s not a consecutive sequence. To me, the Dharma is kaleidoscopic. Each little bit of the path catches and mirrors back countless other pieces of the path.

### ID: p31-45
I’ve spent a lot of time tuning into ethics (known as sīla in Pāli), the three stages along the Eightfold Path — right speech, right action, and right livelihood. Growing up, I received messages that it was okay to screw other people over to get ahead. This ethos ran deep, and I’ve had to, and continue to do a lot of undoing and behavioral remodeling work. I don’t waste the suffering that can be transmuted when I am tempted to or act in an unskillful way and catch myself. I check how my body and heart feel, note it, and investigate those qualities. I also try not to beat myself up and instead practice self-compassion. And when I choose a skillful action, I feel into the gratitude and joy, how it emerges in my body, and I try to expand that.

A big part of staying sober has also been handling loss. A cou ple years ago, my ex-partner died from addiction. They weren’t only my ex-partner, but they were one of my strongest recovery inspirations when I was in early sobriety. Together we founded the group that would lat er become Recovery Dharma NYC. I am still taking advice they shared when we were in each other’s lives. And I’m heartbroken that the pull of escaping with substances overpowered their ability to take one of their own pieces of advice that they gave me after they started using again, “It’s much easier to stay sober than to get sober.” They told me they struggled with presenting as trans feminine in the world while sober — the fre quent affronts of harassment, rage, rudeness, and microaggressions were heavy to handle.
