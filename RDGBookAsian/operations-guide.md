## AI Assistant Instructions 
- Understand that the focus of the current work is Chapter 9 "What is Recovery Dharma"   
  When this changes, this document will be updated
 - increment the json version in metadata section of rdg_en_v3.json after each change   



## Development Guardrails
- Be rollback-ready at all times (retain prior configs and builds).
- NEVER mark stages as complete in STATUS.md - Always wait for explicit user confirmation before marking any stage, micro-version, or task as completed. The user will review implementation and confirm completion status.
