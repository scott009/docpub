## Chapter 8: PREFACE

### ID: p8-1
Once we make a decision to recover from addiction — to sub stances, habits, people, whatever — it can be scary. The feeling is often one of loss and loneliness, because recovery can shake our sense of some of our core identities, and the concept of who we are. How will I relate to others? How can I remain steadfast in my decision? Change can be hard to face, even if we know we’re letting go of something that’s a danger to us. Recovery Dharma offers resources and a supportive setting for this brave change no matter what part of the journey you’re on.

This book presents the use of Buddhist practices and principles to recover from addiction of all kinds, without the requirement of be coming a Buddhist. The Buddha taught that due to craving, greed, anger, and confusion, the mind may be a source of great suffering. With this path, we’re using an ancient and proven way to transform our minds and behavior. We’re choosing to trust in our own potential for wisdom, awakening, and compassion for others and ourselves.

This book is a collaboration from members of our community. It’s intended as a supportive guide for those new to this path as well as long-term practitioners. It’s structured around the “three jewels” of Bud dhism: the Buddha (the potential for our own awakening and the goal of the path), the Dharma (the teachings/how we get there), and the Sangha (our community of wise friends/who we travel with). We’ll share how we have used these teachings to recover from addiction in a way that honors what is wise and helpful for us individually, as opposed to a one-size-fits all approach.

Each of us has our own unique identities and life experiences. Some of us have experienced trauma or lifelong challenges due to being a minority in race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, social class status, disability status, etc. Our program recognizes that being in recovery also means healing and gaining wisdom within our own social identities. We encourage you to adapt this book and create inquiries that may help promote healing, growth, and understanding based on your own identity and experience.
