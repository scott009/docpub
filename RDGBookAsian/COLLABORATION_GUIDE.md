# Collaboration Guide for RDGBookAsian

## Welcome Collaborators!

This guide helps new collaborators get started on the RDGBookAsian project, whether you're working with Claude Code, another AI assistant, or manually.

## Prerequisites
- GitHub account with access to https://github.com/scott009/RDGBookAsian
- Training/approval from project owner (scott@farclass.com)
- Familiarity with markdown editing
- Basic understanding of JSON structure (helpful but not required)

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Read Required Documents
Read these files in order:
1. `SESSION_CONTEXT.md` - Current project status
2. This file - `COLLABORATION_GUIDE.md`
3. `Status.md` - Project history and achievements
4. `operations-guide.md` - Development guardrails
5. `RDGAsianMaster_structure.md` - Content structure

### Step 2: Understand the Master File
- **RDGAsianMaster.json** is the authoritative source of truth
- All work eventually flows back to this file
- DO NOT edit this file directly unless instructed
- Changes go: Markdown → Review → Approval → Reintegration to JSON

### Step 3: Set Up Your Branch
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/scott009/RDGBookAsian.git
cd RDGBookAsian

# Create your working branch
git checkout -b claude/your-task-name-[session-id]

# Or if working on existing branch
git checkout [branch-name]
```

## Workflow Overview

### For Editing Content

```
1. Select Section → 2. Edit Markdown → 3. Review → 4. Commit → 5. Push → 6. Request Approval → 7. Reintegrate to JSON
```

### 1. Select a Section to Work On
Available sections:
- Section 1: Title, Legal, Dedication (`section1_title_legal_dedication_english.md`)
- Section 2: Table of Contents (`section2_table_of_contents_english.md`)
- Section 3: Preface (`section3_preface_english.md`)
- Section 4: Introduction (`section4_introduction_english.md`)
- Section 5: Truths and Paths (`section5_truths_and_paths_english.md`)
- Section 6: Community (`section6_community_english.md`)
- Section 7: Recovery is Possible (`section7_recovery_is_possible_english.md`)
- Section 8: Personal Stories (`section8_personal_stories_english.md`)

### 2. Edit the Markdown File

**Online Options**:
- **GitHub Web Editor**: Click "Edit" button on file in GitHub
- **StackEdit.io**: Connect to GitHub, edit with preview
- **HackMD**: Import from GitHub, collaborative editing
- **Prose.io**: GitHub-integrated markdown editor

**Local Options**:
- Any text editor (VS Code, Sublime, Notepad++)
- Markdown editors (Typora, MarkText, etc.)

### 3. ID Management Rules
- IDs follow pattern: `p[chapter]-[number]`
- Examples: `p9-1`, `p10-5`, `p11a-3`
- **DO NOT** change existing IDs unless specifically instructed
- When adding new content, follow numbering sequence
- See `ID_SPECIFICATION.md` for detailed rules

### 4. Commit Your Changes
```bash
# Stage your changes
git add section*_english.md

# Commit with clear message
git commit -m "Update Section 4: Fixed typos and improved clarity in Chapter 9"

# Push to your branch
git push -u origin [your-branch-name]
```

### 5. Request Review
- Notify project owner that work is ready for review
- Provide summary of changes made
- Wait for approval before considering work complete

### 6. After Approval
- Changes will be reintegrated into RDGAsianMaster.json
- Reintegration script will handle the technical details
- DO NOT manually update the master JSON

## Working with AI Assistants

### If Using Claude Code
1. Provide context by referencing SESSION_CONTEXT.md
2. Specify which section you're working on
3. Request specific edits or improvements
4. Review AI changes before committing
5. Use TodoWrite tool to track multi-step tasks

### If Using Another AI (ChatGPT, etc.)
1. Copy relevant sections from SESSION_CONTEXT.md into your conversation
2. Be explicit about file paths and structure
3. Review all AI-generated changes carefully
4. Test any scripts before running on actual files

### Best Practices
- ✅ Read documentation before starting
- ✅ Work on designated branches
- ✅ Commit frequently with clear messages
- ✅ Wait for approval before marking tasks complete
- ✅ Ask questions when uncertain
- ❌ Don't edit RDGAsianMaster.json directly
- ❌ Don't change IDs without instruction
- ❌ Don't merge to main branch without permission
- ❌ Don't mark stages complete in Status.md (owner does this)

## Branch Naming Convention
Format: `claude/[task-description]-[session-id]`
Example: `claude/edit-section-5-011CUtTgXHAgHdwcMFgSfCSA`

## Communication Channels
- **Project Owner**: scott@farclass.com
- **Issues**: Use GitHub Issues for questions/discussions
- **Pull Requests**: For submitting completed work
