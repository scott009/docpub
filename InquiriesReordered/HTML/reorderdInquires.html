<h3>Why Re-Order the Questions for Inquiry?</h3>
<p class="preamble1" id="pream-29">&quot; Beginning the inquiry process can be daunting . After working with the process for some time with several people, I realized that:</p>
<p class="preamble1" id="pream-30">…j ust as the Dharma is meant to be practiced in a non-linear , holistic way, and just as the four noble truths are universal and non-linear , the inquiry process might be best approached from a new angle.</p>
<p class="preamble1" id="pream-31">Starting with Wise Understanding seemed important, followed by moving into some compassionate investigation of negative self-talk, and perhaps dishonesty towards oneself [as Wise &#x27;Self-Speech&#x27;]. From there, understanding is built by exploring the cause of suffering, in the 2nd Noble Truth and then hope is cultivated by discussing the reality of the end of suffering in the 3rd Noble Truth.</p>
<p class="preamble1" id="pream-32">From this place it becomes easier to direct Wise Effort into recovery with compassion and understanding, and in so doing cultivate the skillful application of meditation through Wise Mindfulness and Concentration. After establishing the practice and putting effort into recovery for some time, one might be ready to explore the harm that has occurred in life with a new perspective. Wise Speech with a broader focus is a starting point for this, followed by the 1st Noble Truth inquiry, which can be heavy. The 4th Noble Truth, with its emphasis on taking refuge, seemed a good place to come back to after the 1st noble truth inquiry, especially with its encouragement to connect to sangha. Amends is next with Wise Intention, and Wise Action gives us the opportunity to begin applying the 5 precepts in daily life. Finally, after a period of recovery, we can investigate and perhaps recommit to Wise Livelihood.&quot;</p>

<p class="preamble1" id="pream-34">[Summary : Wise Understanding → &quot;Self-Speech&quot; → 2NT, 3NT → Wise Effort, Mindfulness, Concentration → Wise Speech → 1NT, 4NT → Wise Intention, Action, Livelihood]</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>
<ul>
<li>6-Month Schedule : Questions are nicely paced into 20 weeks. Including 4 weeks of floating holidays, this fits just right into a 6-month schedule.</li>
<li>Grounding Tips : BEFORE answering the questions each week, we recommend doing the brief grounding exercise for each section, for mental concentration, trauma sensitivity, and emotional preparation. RD strives to be trauma-informed—and since you&#x27;re in the driver&#x27;s seat of the inquiry questions, only you can decide what works for you. AFTER answering the questions each week, we will end by offering ourselves genuine positive feedback to counteract sections of difficult feelings during the inquiry.</li>
