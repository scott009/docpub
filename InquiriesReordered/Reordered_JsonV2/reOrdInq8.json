After establishing the practice and putting effort into recovery for some time, one might be ready to explore the harm that has occurred in life with a new perspective. Wise Speech with a broader focus is a starting point for this, followed by the 1st Noble Truth inquiry, which can be heavy. The 4th Noble Truth, with its emphasis on taking refuge, seemed a good place to come back to after the 1st noble truth inquiry, especially with its encouragement to connect to sangha. Amends is next with Wise Intention, and Wise Action gives us the opportunity to begin applying the 5 precepts in daily life. Finally, after a period of recovery, we can investigate and perhaps recommit to Wise Livelihood.\"",
